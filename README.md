# Qompute

![GitHub Workflow Status][1] ![Codecov][2] ![GitHub Workflow Status][3]

A quantum computing library written in Rust to be :fire:blazingly fast:fire:
[(\s)](https://toneindicators.carrd.co/#masterlist).

## Further Steps

- [ ] Have `ComplexObject` types use a more space-efficient method of
storing data, especially one that permits views and lifetimes.
- [ ] Unsure that the entire library is "safe," which is to say that all
possibilities of panicking are properly documented, and implementations that
are meant to be infallible truly are.
